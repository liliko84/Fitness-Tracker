# Fitness-Tracker
As a user, we are able to view create and track daily workouts, also can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. we can also track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, we can  track the distance traveled(Add exercises to a previous workout plan, Add new exercises to a new workout plan,
View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the stats page).It has 3 pages with all the information on it.

We have public folder in which are the html and javascript for all those three pages and have routes folder to connect all those methods and functions to each other.so we can have the final project.

We have models in which we have data for the exercises, we used mangoose in this case.
